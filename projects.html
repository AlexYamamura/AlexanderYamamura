                <img src = "wordle/wordle-example2.png">
                <p>The inspiration for this project was the popular word puzzle game Wordle. I found myself struggling to figure out which words could match my clues, 
                    and so I developed this app to help narrow down the possible words when playing. In this
                    game, a 5 letter word of the day is chosen. You are given 5 guesses which all must be valid english words. Each guess tells you 
                    whether each letter appears in word in the right spot, is in the word but in the wrong place, or not in the word, denoted by the colors 
                    green, yellow, and grey respectively. The goal is to correctly guess the word by the end of your 6th guess. I utilized 
                    Android Studio for the frontend app and Django Framework to set up a database and keep track of user guesses and possible remaining words. 
                    The goal of the project was to create a functional end-to-end product which correctly created a list of words that your guesses had narrowed down to.

                    <p> At this point, we see that we actually had a 50-50 chance to get the correct answer. The app does allow you
                        to continue guessing other words however, so inputting our last word does leave us with only one option, input! </p>

                    <p>At this stage we got our answer! While not the prettiest, this app showcased my learning of Android Studios and Django. I utilized Java
                        for the frontend (although I did have the urge to try Kotlin) since it was a familiar language and I wanted to focus on one thing at a time. 
                        Having never used Django before but familiar with REST APIs, the framework allowed me to use Python to jumpstart the project, and I later improved 
                        on the backend by connecting the app to a PostgreSQL database so that I could store each session. Completing the actual wordbank logic was 
                        the easy part of this project, and I definitely had to overcome many challenges to get exactly the output I wanted. Thankfully, I now have a clear 
                        idea of how these tools can be used to create interesting projects for the future!
