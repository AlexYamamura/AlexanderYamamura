                <p>This is the website you are on right now! While looking into libraries and frameworks I could use to build this site,
                    I decided to stick to just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I plan on utilizing Angular and React for other projects which are more
                    suited to bindings and responsive inputs, and focused on creating a clean look for the site with simple animations and graphics.
                    Here you will find the basic summary of the projects I have worked on and what I can do. I am always trying to learn new libraries 
                    and frameworks so be on the lookout for new projects that showcase these skills!

                <p>I actually was first introduced to HTML back in elementary school during one of our classes on the internet. I saw how 
                    easy it was to actually start creating an entire website from scratch, just with a couple of divs! Of course those websites 
                    were basically big boxes, but eventually we learned about CSS and how to style the pages we built. Still not winning any awards, 
                    but the box model of margins and padding, the hexadecimal color schemes, and the basic layout of designing webpages all made 
                    a lasting impact on me then and have carried over to into the present. Later as a coding instructor, I was asked to learn about Angular 
                    so I could help teach a class, and I began my deeper dive into frameworks that could help create responsive web pages. This 
                    was where it became clear how a website worked under the hood, and how information was utilized by webpages to respond to 
                    requests and inputs. I also learned how to use graphics and CSS animations to help highlight user interactivity, and what 
                    items were clickable or what buttons to press.

                <p>Some of the things I focused on while building this website were good visuals and CSS animations. I wanted to make sure 
                    there was a clean flow to the webpage, as well as a clear place to find out more information about me and my projects.
                    These included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cloud animation on homepage</li>

                    <p>
                        I especially loved how simple a lot of the CSS animations were to implement. It did not take a lot of code to get an 
                        image to jump up and down, or to expand on hover, or darken a background. Finding out new tricks and methods to add depth 
                        to the webpage was very exciting, and I will definitely be adding these skills to any front-end projects in the future.

                <p>The inspiration for this project was the popular word puzzle game Wordle. I found myself struggling to figure out which words could match my clues, 
                    and so I developed this app to help narrow down the possible words when playing. In this
                    game, a 5 letter word of the day is chosen. You are given 5 guesses which all must be valid english words. Each guess tells you 
                    whether each letter appears in word in the right spot, is in the word but in the wrong place, or not in the word, denoted by the colors 
                    green, yellow, and grey respectively. The goal is to correctly guess the word by the end of your 6th guess. I utilized 
                    Android Studio for the frontend app and Django Framework to set up a database and keep track of user guesses and possible remaining words. 
                    The goal of the project was to create a functional end-to-end product which correctly created a list of words that your guesses had narrowed down to.

                    <p>At this stage we got our answer! While not the prettiest, this app showcased my learning of Android Studios and Django. I utilized Java
                        for the frontend (although I did have the urge to try Kotlin) since it was a familiar language and I wanted to focus on one thing at a time. 
                        Having never used Django before but familiar with REST APIs, the framework allowed me to use Python to jumpstart the project, and I later improved 
                        on the backend by connecting the app to a PostgreSQL database so that I could store each session. Completing the actual wordbank logic was 
                        the easy part of this project, and I definitely had to overcome many challenges to get exactly the output I wanted. Thankfully, I now have a clear 
                        idea of how these tools can be used to create interesting projects for the future!

                <p>This was our senior design project at UCI. For the project 3 team members and I worked with a navy liason who was our advisor and met 
                    with weekly to discuss the features of our robot. The goal of the project was to build a prototype autonomous target robot which 
                    would help the accuracy of soldiers at the shooting range. For this project we worked with a RaspberryPi along with several modules 
                    such as a GPS, magnetometer, IMU, and motor arm. The main logic was written in Python, with a front-end UI in Java Swing. 
                    Our prototype was capable of moving within a 25ftx25ft box where it generated 5 random locations to stop, turn, and detect a hit by 
                    shooters, before returning back to the base location. Over the course of the project, I learned many things about using these 
                    modules to handle real world problems that machines have to face. Implementing all the features was a challenge, but in the end 
                    our team delivered a finished project that exceeded our requirements.

                <p>
                    I mainly dealt with the back-end logic for the movement and function of the robot. This included all aspects of the 
                    movement such as its GPS location, direction, turn angles, raising the target arm, and recording hits. There were several 
                    challenges to overcome with each feature.

                        <h2>Movement</h2>
                        <p>
                            The main issue was how to go a specific distance using calculations from the GPS module. To do this, the initial 
                            thought was to utilize the tread motors for a specific interval, and use the amount of time to determine the distance. 
                            This worked for flat ground, however if on uneven terrain this would not work. A PID controller was used in conjunction with 
                            this method, and this allowed us to determine whether we had actually made it to our desired GPS location, or if we needed to 
                            continue to move forward, and correct for errors.

                        <h2>Angles</h2>
                        <p>
                            At each location, the robot had to turn to face the base station after movement, so that the user could shoot at the 
                            target face. Due to the modules having some error when determining the exact angle, a rapid sample of the gps locations 
                            were averaged together, and calculations using the Pythagorean Theorem were done to point in the correct direction by 
                            moving each tread in opposite directions to turn.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Hit Detection</h2>
                        <p>
                            Initially the hit detection was going off during movement, since an IMU was mounted on the arm to detect z-axis 
                            movement. The simple fix was to disable detection until the robot had reached a position, and set a high threshold 
                            to trigger a hit counter. This was allowable since it was meant to be used outdoors where bullets would be moving 
                            much faster than other forces.
