                <p>The inspiration for this project was the popular word puzzle game Wordle. I found myself struggling to figure out which words could match my clues, 
                    and so I developed this app to help narrow down the possible words when playing. In this
                    game, a 5 letter word of the day is chosen. You are given 5 guesses which all must be valid english words. Each guess tells you 
                    whether each letter appears in word in the right spot, is in the word but in the wrong place, or not in the word, denoted by the colors 
                    green, yellow, and grey respectively. The goal is to correctly guess the word by the end of your 6th guess. I utilized 
                    Android Studio for the frontend app and Django Framework to set up a database and keep track of user guesses and possible remaining words. 
                    The goal of the project was to create a functional end-to-end product which correctly created a list of words that your guesses had narrowed down to.
