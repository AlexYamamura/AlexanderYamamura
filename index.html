                        <p>An avid programmer and nature lover, I graduated from the University of California, Irvine in 2020 with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering and a minor in Psychology and Social Behavior. Since graduating I have continued my job as a coding
                            instructor at TaeCoding, teaching high school students in a wide variety of coding topics and languages. I am seeking a software engineering job anywhere in the stack, from front-end to back-end to full stack development.
